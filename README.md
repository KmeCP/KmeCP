Education:
Straight Cs student in highschool with 1.8 GPA.

Programming - I started off by coding programs in Lua for about 5 years through ROBLOX games. However, I recently became interested in programming things such as simulations, system utilities, graphics generation, renderers, and algebraic calculators. I am comfortable with problem solving and I am able to sit down and work on a problem for hours on end until I finish it.

Computer hardware - desktops, routers, I/O devices, motherboards, and servers.
